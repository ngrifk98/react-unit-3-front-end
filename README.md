# React Unit 3: Whisked Wonders: NGK's Culinary Escapades

In this project, I had the fantastic opportunity to delve into the world of React and create a culinary-focused web application called "Whisked Wonders: NGK's Culinary Escapades." The goal of this project was to develop an interactive recipe-sharing platform where users can explore, create, and share their favorite recipes.

## Learning and Implementing React Router

One of the key aspects of this project was learning and implementing React Router. React Router allowed me to create multiple views within a single-page application, providing a seamless and dynamic user experience. This was crucial for enabling users to navigate between different sections of the application without having to reload the entire page.

By using React Router, I was able to set up various routes for different components, such as the home screen, new recipe form, and detailed recipe view. This made the application organized and user-friendly, as users could easily switch between these views using navigation links or by typing in specific URLs.

## Creating Views and Components

To bring NGK's Culinary Escapades to life, I created several distinct components to handle different aspects of the application. The **HomeScreen** component served as the main landing page, displaying a collection of featured recipes and providing a search bar for users to find specific recipes.

The **NewRecipeScreen** component allowed users to contribute their own culinary creations by submitting new recipes. This form-based view guided users through the process of adding recipe details, ingredients, and instructions, providing a user-friendly experience for sharing recipes.

For a more in-depth look at individual recipes, the **DetailScreen** component presented a detailed view of a specific recipe. Users could access this view by clicking on a recipe's title or through direct URL navigation. The details included the recipe's image, ingredients, cooking instructions, and additional information.

## Styling and Design

Aesthetic appeal was an important aspect of the project. By combining CSS styling and layout techniques, I was able to create an engaging and visually pleasing user interface. Each component's styling was customized to match NGK's culinary theme, utilizing a color palette inspired by ingredients and culinary concepts.

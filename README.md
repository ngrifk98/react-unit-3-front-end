## Introduction

As part of the React Unit 3 assignment, I learned to work with React Router to create multiple views within the same web application. The goal was to build a user-friendly recipe-sharing platform that allows users to create, view, and share their culinary creations.

## Features

- Home Screen: The home screen displays featured recipes and provides a search bar to find specific recipes.
- New Recipe Form: Users can submit their own recipes using a form with fields for recipe details.
- Recipe Details: Users can view detailed information about a specific recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
- Navigation: The navigation bar allows users to easily switch between different sections of the website.

## Technologies Used

- React: Used for building the user interface components and managing views.
- React Router: Implemented for navigation and creating multiple views within the app.
- Axios: Used for making API requests to interact with the backend.
- CSS: Styled the components and created a visually appealing design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-unit-3-front-end`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Visit the website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Explore featured recipes on the home screen.
3. Create a new recipe using the "New Recipe" form.
4. Click on a recipe to view its details.
5. Use the search bar to find specific recipes.
